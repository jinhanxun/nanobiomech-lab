### **Characterization and Inverse Design of Stochastic Mechanical Metamaterials Using Neural Operators**

**H. Jin†, B. Zhang, Q. Cao, E. Zhang, A. Bora, S. Krishnaswamya, G. E. Karniadakis, H. D. Espinosa**

*Advanced Materials* 2025, 2420063

**DOI:** [10.1002/adma.202420063](https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202420063)

Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of mechanical metamaterials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable through lab-based trial-and-error methods. However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for designing micro-scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, a comprehensive end-to-end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (including DeepONet and its variants) is introduced, to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental data.

### **Harnessing Machine Learning for Quantum-Accurate Predictions of Non-Equilibrium Behavior in 2D Materials**

**Y. Zhang, R. J. Appleton, K. Lin, M. J. McCarthy, J. T. Paci, S. K.R.S. Sankaranarayanan, A. Strachan, H. D. Espinosa†**

*ArXiv* 2025, 2504.09686

**DOI:** [10.48550/arXiv.2504.09686](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.09686)

Accurately predicting the non-equilibrium mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for understanding their deformation, thermo-mechanical properties, and failure mechanisms. In this study, we parameterize and evaluate two machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials, SNAP and Allegro, for modeling the non-equilibrium behavior of monolayer MoSe2. Using a density functional theory (DFT) derived dataset, we systematically compare their accuracy and transferability against the physics-based Tersoff force field.

### **Large scale polymer toughening of two-dimensional materials revealed by in situ TEM fracture tests and multiscale simulations**

**Y. Zhang, C. Li, X. Zhang, J. Wen, A. V. Sumant, A. Strachan, H. D. Espinosa†**

*European Journal of Mechanics – A/Solids* 2025, 114, 105748

**DOI:** [10.1016/j.euromechsol.2024.105748](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euromechsol.2024.105748)

Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer significant potential for applications in energy-harvesting devices, batteries, sensors, and transistors. However, their intrinsic brittleness makes them prone to mechanical failure, limiting their practical use. In this work, we perform in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) fracture tests on monolayer MoSe2 and uncover an extrinsic toughening effect induced by an ultrathin adsorbed polystyrene adlayer.

### **A Novel MEMS Platform for Thermomechanical Characterization of Nanomaterials**

**D. Kundu, B. Zhang, Z. Lin, G. Richter, H. D. Espinosa†**

*Experimental Mechanics* 2025

**DOI:** [10.1007/s11340-024-01058-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11340-024-01058-8)

Thermomechanical testing of nanomaterials is essential to assess their performance in applications where thermal and mechanical loads occur simultaneously. However, developing a multi-physics testing platform for nanomaterials that integrates temperature control, displacement control, and force sensing remains challenging due to the interference between heating and mechanical testing components.

### **Ex-Vivo Mechano-Structural Characterization of Fresh Diseased Human Esophagus**

**N. A. Alderete, J. W. Hwang, M. Asgari, R. Benavides, S. Halder, L. Sun, D. Carlson, E. Goudie, D. A. Farina, S. Kim, D. P. Pearce, C. M. Witzenburg, N. A. Patankar, G. Y. Yang, J. E. Pandolfino, S. Sarikaya, H. D. Espinosa†**

*Acta Biomaterialia* 2025 (196), pp.257-270

**DOI:** [10.1016/j.actbio.2024.12.015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2024.12.015)

The esophagus, the tube-like organ responsible for transporting food from the pharynx to the stomach, operates as a highly mechanical structure, exhibiting complex contraction and distension patterns triggered by neurological impulses. Despite the critical role of mechanics in its function and the need for high-fidelity models of esophageal transport, mechanical characterization studies of human esophagus remain relatively scarce.

### **Microfluidic cells for the 1–100 MPa pressure range**

**N. Moldovan†, H. Zeng, N. A Alderete, B. Matos-Vazquez, R. Divan, H. D. Espinosa†**

*Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering* 2025

**DOI:** [10.1088/1361-6439/ad4c8a](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6439/ad4c8a)

Thin membrane-delimited fluid cells supporting up to 1 at (0.1 MPa) of pressure are well known and commercially available for use in vacuum chambers of electron, photon, or various particle beam microscopies or spectroscopies. Hereby, we report on the development of fluid cells capable of working at 1–10 MPa, extending the analysis domain for investigating chemical, biochemical, or physical processes at pressures of interest in chemical synthesis, underwater biochemistry studies or underground geology.

### **Does the mantis shrimp pack a phononic shield?**

**N. A. Alderete, S. Sandeep, S. Raetz, M. Asgari, M. Abi Ghanem†, H. D. Espinosa†**

*Science* 2025 (387), 6734, pp.659-666

**DOI:** [10.1126/science.adk3888](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adk3888)

The powerful strikes generated by the smasher mantis shrimp require it to possess a robust protection mechanism to withstand the resultant forces. Although recent studies have suggested that phononic bandgaps complement the mantis shrimp's defensive suite, direct experimental evidence for this mechanism has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the phononic properties of the mantis shrimp's dactyl club using laser ultrasonic techniques and numerical simulations.
