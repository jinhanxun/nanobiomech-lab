**Assistant Professor**  
Department of Mechanical Engineering  
[Your University Name]

**<u>H. Jin</u>** leads the NanoBioMech Lab, where research focuses on the intersection of nanomechanics, biomechanics, and artificial intelligence. He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Before joining [University], he was a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University working with Prof. Horacio Espinosa, where he developed machine learning frameworks for the design and characterization of mechanical metamaterials. Hanxun obtained his PhD from Brown University under the guidance of Prof. Kyung-Suk Kim, where he pioneered deep learning approaches for analyzing dynamic fracture in nanostructured materials.

His research interests include mechanical metamaterials, machine learning for materials design, nanomechanics, experimental solid mechanics, physics-informed neural networks, and high-rate material characterization. He is the author of over 15 journal publications in top-tier journals including *Advanced Materials*, *Science Advances*, *Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids*, and *Applied Mechanics Reviews*.
